# 🛡️ OWASP Top 10 – Security Playbook

> A **deep, structured, and practitioner-grade** repository covering the OWASP Top 10 across  
> **Web Applications, Penetration Testing, AI Security, and Product Security**.

This repository is built to **explain security, not just list vulnerabilities**.  
Every section focuses on **why issues exist, how they are abused, and how secure systems are actually built**.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Is

✔️ A **reference playbook** for real-world security work  
✔️ A **learning path** from fundamentals → exploitation → secure design  
✔️ A **portfolio-grade repository** for AppSec, Pentesting, AI Security & Product Security roles  

---

## 🚫 What This Repository Is NOT

❌ A checklist dump  
❌ A copy-paste of OWASP documentation  
❌ Shallow “what is XSS” explanations  

This repo is designed for people who want to **think like security engineers and attackers**.

- Threat modeling
- Microservices & API risks
- Dependency & supply chain security
- Logging, detection & abuse cases

➡️ Ideal for **Product Security Engineers, Security Leads, Architects**

---

## 🧠 How Each OWASP Topic Is Structured

Each OWASP category is broken down **without cross-points**, following a clear depth-first approach:

- Overview
- Why It Exists
- How It Happens
- Real-World Attack Scenarios
- Detection & Validation
- Exploitation (where applicable)
- Mitigation & Secure Design
- Engineering Takeaways


This ensures **clarity, flow, and real understanding**.

---

## 🧩 Why This Repo Is Different

🔍 **Explains root causes**, not just symptoms  
⚔️ **Attacker + Defender perspectives** in separate sections  
🏗️ **Engineering-first security**, not tool-first  
🤖 Includes **modern AI security risks**, not just classic web vulns  
📈 Designed to **scale from learning → interviews → real work**

---
