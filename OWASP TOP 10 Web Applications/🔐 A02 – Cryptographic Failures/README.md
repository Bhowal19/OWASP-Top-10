# A02 – Cryptographic Failures

Occurs when applications fail to properly protect sensitive data.

## Root Causes
- Weak encryption algorithms
- Hardcoded secrets
- Poor key management
- Missing encryption in transit or at rest

## Secure Design
- Use modern cryptography standards
- Enforce HTTPS everywhere
- Secure key storage (KMS, Vault)
