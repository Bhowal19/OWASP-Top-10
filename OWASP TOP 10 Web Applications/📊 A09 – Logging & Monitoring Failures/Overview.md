# A09 – Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

Logging and monitoring failures occur when systems do not generate, retain, or analyze the information needed to detect and respond to security incidents.

In many breaches, the compromise itself is not sophisticated.
What is sophisticated is how long it goes unnoticed.

Attackers rely on silence.
They rely on systems that fail to observe themselves.
They rely on organizations that only investigate after damage is visible.

A09 exists because security controls that cannot be observed cannot be defended.
If an action is not logged, it might as well not have happened.

Logging is not about compliance.
Monitoring is not about dashboards.
They are about awareness.
