# Detection

Detecting logging and monitoring failures often happens after an incident.

Security teams realize they cannot answer basic questions:
Who accessed the system?
What actions were performed?
How long did the attacker remain?

Detection depends on visibility.
If logs exist, but lack context, timelines cannot be reconstructed.
If alerts exist, but lack prioritization, signals are missed.

Indicators of logging failure include:
Delayed incident response.
Inability to scope impact.
Dependence on external reports or user complaints.

The absence of evidence is itself evidence.
When systems cannot explain their own behavior, logging has failed.
