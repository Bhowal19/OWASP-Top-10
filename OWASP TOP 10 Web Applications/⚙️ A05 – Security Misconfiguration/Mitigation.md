# Mitigation

Mitigating security misconfiguration requires shifting from reactive fixes to proactive control.

Secure baselines must be defined and enforced.
Systems should be deployed in a secure state by default, with unsafe options requiring deliberate opt-in.

Configuration should be versioned, reviewed, and tested just like code.
Infrastructure-as-Code becomes a strength only when security policies are embedded into it.

Access should follow the principle of least privilege.
Every permission granted should have a clear reason and an expiration.
Temporary access should not become permanent through neglect.

Monitoring is essential.
Misconfiguration cannot be prevented entirely, but it can be detected quickly.
Visibility turns silent exposure into actionable risk.

Mitigation succeeds when insecure states are **hard to create and easy to detect**.
