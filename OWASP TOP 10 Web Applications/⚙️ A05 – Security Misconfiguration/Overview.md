# A05 – Security Misconfiguration

Security Misconfiguration occurs when systems are deployed, configured, or maintained in an insecure state.
Unlike vulnerabilities that require complex exploitation, misconfigurations often expose systems **without any attack at all**.

In many breaches, attackers do not exploit flaws.
They simply discover systems that were never locked down.

This category exists because modern systems are complex.
They involve frameworks, cloud services, containers, APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and third-party integrations.
Each layer introduces configuration decisions.
Each decision is an opportunity for failure.

Security misconfiguration is dangerous because it feels harmless.
The system works.
Features function.
Performance is fine.

Only later does the organization realize that it was operating with its doors open.
