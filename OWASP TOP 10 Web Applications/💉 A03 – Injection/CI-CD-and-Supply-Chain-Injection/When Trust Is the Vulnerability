Supply chain injection occurs when attackers introduce malicious instructions into dependencies, updates, or build artifacts.

Unlike classic injection, the attacker does not need direct access to the target system.
They inject into something the system already trusts.

Package managers install code automatically.
Build systems execute scripts automatically.
Update mechanisms apply changes automatically.

Each of these is an interpreter acting on external input.

A developer adds a dependency.
The dependency contains a post-install script.
The script executes during installation.
The attacker’s code runs inside thousands of environments.

No exploit chain is required.
Trust is the exploit.

Supply chain injection is devastating because it breaks a fundamental assumption:
that dependencies are passive.

They are not.
They execute.
